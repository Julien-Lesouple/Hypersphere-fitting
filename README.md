# Hypersphere-fitting
This repository contains codes associated with my works on hypersphere fitting

## IEEE-SPL
This folder contains codes associated with the paper "Hypersphere Fitting from Noisy Data Using an EM Algorithm" accepted in IEEE Signal Processing Letters.

### MATLAB
This folder contains Matlab codes that allows to reproduce most of the results in the article, namely Figs. 2, 4, 5 and 6 and Table 1, as well as Figs. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 of the technical report. 
It borrows two functions from Matlab File Exchange :
- vmrand by Dylan Muir(http://dylan-muir.com/): https://fr.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/37241-vmrand-fmu-fkappa-varargin
- SphericalDistributionsRand by Yu-Hui Chen (https://github.com/yuhuichen1015/): https://fr.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/52398-sphericaldistributionsrand

### PYTHON
This folder contains a light Jupyter notebook to try the proposed algorithm.
